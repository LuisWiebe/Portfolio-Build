                <h1>Nice to Meet you!</h1>
                <p>My name is Luis Wiebe, I'm a Graphic Designer, Character Artist, and Photographer out of CDA, ID. It brings me elation to bring other peoples' visions to life while getting to have some creative freedom when permitted. In my free time I throughouly enjoy going to conventions around Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. Either dressed up myself or taking photos for my cosplay friends I meetup with. If not conventions, I indulge in lots and lots of video games, sinking hours worth of gameplay into a various library of games and content. If I'm feeling adventerous, I love to embroider fun and cutesy visuals into my clothing when inspiration hits at random, or from scrolling Instagram and Pinterest.</p>
                <p>I'm adept in Illustrator, Photoshop, Clip Studio Paint, and have dabbled in Lightroom, After Effects, and Premiere Pro. I'm passionate about anything related to early 2000s/Punk visuals, music, fashion and more and that tends to be reflected within my personal pieces, or everyday wear. I'd love to get to know you, dear reader, lets make some magic happen and bring your visions to life! </p>
